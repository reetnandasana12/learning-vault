# Data Structures & Algorithms

A complete reference guide with **C++ and Java** code examples, pattern recognition strategies, and interview tips.

---

## What is DSA?

**Data Structures** organize and store data efficiently.
**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures to solve problems.

Together they form the foundation of software engineering and technical interviews.

---

## Why Learn DSA?

- Solve complex problems efficiently
- Crack top-tier tech interviews (FAANG, startups)
- Write optimized, scalable code
- Think like a computer scientist

---

## How to Use This Guide

Each section covers a topic with:

1. **Concept explanation**
2. **C++ implementation**
3. **Java implementation**
4. **Pattern recognition** — how to identify when to use it
5. **Classic problems** to practice

## Complexity Quick Reference

| Complexity | Name | Example |
|---|---|---|
| O(1) | Constant | Array access |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| O(n) | Linear | Linear scan |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Bubble sort |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | Fibonacci recursive |
| O(n!) | Factorial | Permutations |

## Interview Tips

- Always **clarify constraints** before coding
- State your **approach** before writing code
- Think about **edge cases**: empty input, single element, all same
- Start with **brute force**, then optimize
- Communicate your **time and space complexity**
