# AI Prompts for SQL

A collection of 16 prompt templates for using AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) to accelerate SQL development and learning.

## 1. Solve an SQL Task

> In my SQL Server database, we have two tables: `orders` (order_id, sales, customer_id, product_id) and `customers` (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country).
> Write a query to rank customers based on their sales. Write three different versions and compare readability and performance.

## 2. Improve Readability

> The following SQL Server query is long and hard to understand. Improve its readability, remove redundancy, and explain each change.

## 3. Optimize Performance

> The following SQL Server query is slow. Propose optimizations, provide the improved query, and explain each improvement.

## 4. Analyze Execution Plans

> This image shows the execution plan. Describe it step by step, identify bottlenecks, and suggest optimizations.

## 5. Debug Errors

> The query causes error: "Msg 8120, Level 16, State 1". Explain the error, find the root cause, and suggest how to fix it.

## 6. Explain Results

> I don't understand the result of this query. Break down how SQL processes it step by step.

## 7. Style & Format Code

> Restyle this SQL code: align aliases, keep it compact, follow best practices.

## 8. Documentation & Comments

> This query lacks documentation. Add a leading comment, inline comments where needed, and create a business rules document.

## 9. Improve Database DDL

> Review this DDL for naming consistency, data type optimization, integrity constraints, index coverage, and normalization.

## 10. Generate Test Data

> Generate realistic INSERT statements for this DDL. Keep the dataset small, ensure FK relationships are valid, and avoid NULLs.

## 11. Create a SQL Course

> Create a comprehensive SQL course roadmap: start with fundamentals, advance to complex topics, focus on data analytics use cases.

## 12. Understand a Concept

> Explain SQL Window Functions: what they are, an analogy, when to use them, syntax, examples, and top 3 use cases.

## 13. Compare Concepts

> Compare Window Functions vs GROUP BY: key differences, when to use each, pros/cons, and a side-by-side summary table.

## 14. Practice SQL

> Act as an SQL trainer. Provide a dataset, give tasks that increase in difficulty, simulate SQL Server results, and review my queries.

## 15. Interview Prep

> Act as an interviewer. Ask common SQL interview questions, progress to advanced topics, evaluate my answers, and give feedback.

## 16. Exam Prep

> Prepare me for a SQL exam with practice questions, progressive difficulty, answer evaluation, and feedback.
